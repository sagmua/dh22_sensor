# DHT-22 Sensor:

This is an small project using Arduino to read temperature and humidity data
from a dht-22 sensor. The information will be printed in an LCD (without I2C).

# Dependencies:

This project depends on the following Arduino libraries:
* Liquid-Crystal
* DHT-22 (Adafruit)

# How to compile:
Open the *.ino file using the Arduino IDE.
2. Choose your target board (e.g. Arduino Nano)
3. Click on "Verify"
4. Finally click on "Upload"
